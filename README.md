# home
Shell config files

This is a repository of my home directory. Any necessary .dot files and scripts are installed an linked to the $HOME location
This script will also install my most used apps (Brave, Visual Studio Code, Terraform, Docker, Google backup and sync, etc.)

Currently works for MAC OS only.

To download/install/run this script in one line for MAC OS only:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/version7x/home/master/bin/mac-install.sh)"
